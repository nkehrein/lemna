\title{A Lemna scenario using FOCUS D1 Ditch environmental conditions}
\format{
An object of class \code{lemna_scenario} of length 4.
}
\usage{
focusd1
}
\description{
The dataset consists of a named \code{list} which contains vectors describing
initial state, parameters, output times, and environmental variables of the
Lemna model. The scenario represents conditions of the FOCUS D1 Ditch
exposure scenario.
}
\details{
The scenario will simulate a period of 365 days with hourly outputs, a start
population of 80 g/m² dry weight, variable environmental conditions, and a
complex, time-varying exposure pattern.

The scenario setup was published by Hommen \emph{et al}. (2015). Exposure pattern
and substance specific parameters are of exemplary character
and represent the herbicide \emph{metsulfuron-methyl}.
