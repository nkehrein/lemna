\description{
The function numerically integrates the Lemna model using the supplied
parameters, environmental factor time series, output time points, and other
settings. Numerical integration is handled by \code{\link[deSolve:lsoda]{deSolve::lsoda()}} by default
which is well suited to handle stiff and non-stiff numerical problems.
}
\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{default}: All scenario parameters supplied as arguments

\item \code{lemna_scenario}: Scenario parameters supplied as a \code{lemna_scenario} object
}}

\section{State variables}{

The model has two state variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{BM}, Biomass  (g dw m-2)
\item \code{M_int}, Mass of toxicant in plant population  (mass per m2, e.g. ug m-2)
}
}

\section{Output times}{

The function will only return results for the requested time points. The solver
may make additional time steps which are not returned, depending on the
solver settings such as numerical tolerance. The number of output times and
the distance between them can have influence on the numerical precision of
results. Please refer to the manual of the \link{deSolve} package for more
information on that topic.
}

\section{Parameters}{

The list of available model parameters, their units, and suggested default
values is documented in \code{\link[=param_defaults]{param_defaults()}}.
}

\section{Environmental variables}{

The model requires a time series for each of the five environmental variables
For ease of use, a time series can be represented by either a constant
numeric value, a \code{data.frame} containing a time series, a character
string with a path to a CSV file containing a time series, or a function
returning a value for a certain time point.

The five environmental variables are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{conc}, Exposure concentration (mass per volume, e.g ug L-1)
\item \code{tmp}, Temperature (deg C)
\item \code{irr}, Irradiance (kJ m-2 d-1)
\item \code{P}, Phosphorus concentration  (mg P L-1)
\item \code{N}, Nitrogen concentration  (mg N L-1)
}

A \code{data.frame} containing a time series must consist of exactly two columns:
The first column contains the time in days, the second column the environmental
factor in question. The \code{data.frame} must contain at least one row. Time
points are not required to coincide with the solver's output times but
the user should take care that the solver's time step length is sufficiently
small so that it can consider the relevant dynamics of the time series.
This problem can be avoided by calling the model ODEs implemented in C, see
argument \code{ode_mode}.

If a string is passed as an environmental factor, the function will interpret
the string as a file path and will try to load the contents of a CSV file.
The same requirements as for a \code{data.frame} apply to a time series loaded
from a file.

When using the pure R code ODE, it is also possible to pass a function as
an environmental factor. The function must accept exactly one argument which
represents time and must return a single scalar value. Using a function
in combination with the compiled code solver will raise an error.
}

\section{R vs. compiled code}{

The model can be simulated using pure \emph{R} code (the default) or an implementation
that uses the compiled code feature of \link{deSolve}. Compiled code is almost
always significantly faster than pure \emph{R}. The solver for compiled ODEs also
handles environmental variables better than the pure \emph{R} version. For optimal
performance, the time series of environmental variables should always be as
short as possible and as long as needed.

To use the compiled code feature, set the argument \code{ode_mode = "c"}.
}

\section{Simulation output}{

For reasons of convenience, the return value contains by default two additional
variables derived from simulation results: the internal concentration \code{C_int}
as well as the number of fronds \code{FrondNo}. These can be disabled by setting
the argument \code{nout = 0}.

The compiled code model can return up to 18 additional variables which
represent intermediary variables, environmental variables, and derivatives
calculated within the model equations. Please refer to the model description
of \emph{Klein et al.} for more information on these variables and how they
influence model behavior.

The available output levels are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{nout >= 1}
\itemize{
\item \code{C_int}, internal concentration (mass per volume)
}
\item \code{nout >= 2}
\itemize{
\item \code{FrondNo}, frond number (-)
}
\item \code{nout >= 4}
\itemize{
\item \code{f_loss}, respiration dependency function (-)
\item \code{f_photo}, photosynthesis dependency function (-)
}
\item \code{nout >= 10}
\itemize{
\item \code{fT_photo}, temperature response of photosynthesis (-)
\item \code{fI_photo}, irradiance response of photosynthesis (-)
\item \code{fP_photo}, phosphorus response of photosynthesis (-)
\item \code{fN_photo}, nitrogen response of photosynthesis (-)
\item \code{fBM_photo}, density response of photosynthesis (-)
\item \code{fCint_photo}, concentration response of photosynthesis (-)
}
\item \code{nout >= 16}
\itemize{
\item \code{C_int_unb}, unbound internal concentration (mass per volume)
\item \code{C_ext}, external concentration (mass per volume)
\item \code{Tmp}, temperature (deg C)
\item \code{Irr}, irradiance (kJ m-2 d-1)
\item \code{Phs}, Phosphorus concentration (mg P L-1)
\item \code{Ntr}, Nitrogen concentration (mg N L-1)
}
\item \code{nout >= 18}
\itemize{
\item \code{dBM}, biomass derivative (g dw m-2 d-1)
\item \code{dM_int}, mass of toxicant in plants derivative (mass per m2 d-1)
}
}
}
