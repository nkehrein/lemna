# lemna

## Overview

*lemna* is a software package for the language
[*R*](https://www.r-project.org/). It implements model equations and
default parameters to simulate the toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD)
model of the *Lemna* aquatic plant. *Lemna* is a standard test
macrophyte used in ecotox effect studies. The model was described and
published by the *SETAC Europe Interest Group Effect Modeling* (Klein
*et al.* 2021). It is a refined description of the *Lemna* TKTD model
published by Schmitt *et al.* (2013).

## Installation

``` r
# install directly from CRAN
install.packages("lemna")

# install latest development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("nkehrein/lemna")
```

## Usage

The lemna package provides model equations and some useful helpers to
simulate the growth of *Lemna* (duckweed) aquatic plant populations. A
simulation is run by using the `lemna()` function. The required scenario
data are either supplied individually on function call or are passed as
a pre-defined scenario object, such as the `focusd1` sample scenario:

``` r
library(lemna)

# simulate sample scenario
result <- lemna(focusd1)
head(result)
#>   time       BM     M_int        C_int  FrondNo
#> 1    0 80.00000 0.0000000 0.0000000000 200000.0

## Learning lemna

The package contains two vignettes that may help you getting started:

-   [Introduction to the Lemna
    package](https://nkehrein.github.io/lemna_web/lemna-introduction.html)<br />
    A general *Tutorial* and guide to the package functions
-   [Lemna model
    verification](https://nkehrein.github.io/lemna_web/lemna-verification.html)<br />
    A verification of the model implementation against results of the
    Schmitt *et al.* implementation. Contains advanced workflows of
    package features.

## License
